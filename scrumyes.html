				<p>Purpose of Scrum Yes is to identify the bare minimum  Scrum Methodology in order to be able to get maximum benefits from Scrum with minimal investment.</p>
		
				<p>Agile Scrum methodology implies self-containing and self-managing team.<br><br><br>
					Usually, we talk about teams of 10 that will include following roles:
					Developers, Scrum Master, Product Owner, Architect, Quality Engineer and
					in some cases Technical Writer (Agile is more focused on delivering working 
					software and less the documentation this 
					is why technical writer is optional)Team composition is based on nature of work and current situation of your organization. 
					However, the most important part is that the team will be self-governed and self contained.
				


</p>
				<br><br><br>
				<p>
					<b>There just few simple principles that should be implemented to get benefits of Scrum:</b><br><br>
					<ul>
<li>Self contained team that include all the required roles for team to operate autonomously.</li> 	
<li>Independence of the team from external influence</li>
<li>Division of the deliverables into backlogs that ideally can be completed, tested and deployed in one Sprint</li> 	
<li>Iterative development on Sprint level</li> 						
<li>Definition of done that includes what tasks to be completed to consider BL completed</li> 						<li>Mandatory meetings Planning, Review, Scrum , Retrospective</li> 		
						</ul>
