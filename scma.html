        <p>
        You will not become ScMa just by completing certification - what really counts is experience. However, if you do have experience potential employer tries to get some proof of this experience. This is how they try to protect themselves from fraud. Basically, it is very difficult for interviewer if the interviewer is not ScMa to get feeling about potential ScMa for the role he interviews.

Since it is relatively easy to read the learning material and answer the questions versus knowing how to act and to be able to deliver.

So my feedback will be doing your homework and be self-aware.
          
Certifications I have analyzed basically devided to 3 main groups:
        <ul>
     <li>     
1. Expensive one that offer few days in the classroom and a test. I believe this certificate is more for organizations that want to upskill their ScMa and looking for an easy solution. I personally don’t believe that 2 days in the classroom make any difference however if this training is taken by experienced ScMa it can add value vs. just picking up the theory.
</li>  <li>  
2. Cheap and easy- Cheap test you can execute many times just to get certificate to add to your CV headhunters might not know how easy it is to get such certification.
</li>  <li>
3. Affordable price but more challenging test – this one should be the golden middle for the employer and for a candidate. To pass, the candidate should know some basics also there is no financial barrier to get it.
</li>  
        </ul>
Saying all this certificate by itself adds zero value since Scrum is a simple framework to learn but hard to practice.

*As of today from available certificates I would recommend https://www.scrum.org/.
