				<h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
        You will not become ScMa just by completing certification - <b> what really counts is experience</b>.<br><br>
		However, if you do have experience potential employer tries to get some proof of this experience.
		
<br><br>
Certification is a tool potential employers use for screening.

				<h2>Certifications </h2>
			
There 3 main types of certifications on the market:<br><br>
        <ul>
     <li>     
Expensive one that offer few days in the classroom and a test. I believe this certificate is more for organizations that want to upskill their ScMa and looking for an easy solution. I personally don’t believe that 2 days in the classroom make any difference however if this training is taken by experienced ScMa it can add value vs. just picking up the theory.
<br><br></li>  <li>  
Cheap and easy- Cheap test you can execute many times just to get certificate to add to your CV headhunters might not know how easy it is to get such certification.
<br><br></li>  <li>
 Affordable price but more challenging test – this one should be the golden middle for the employer and for a candidate. To pass, the candidate should know some basics also there is no financial barrier to get it.
</li>  
        </ul><br>
Saying all this certificate by itself adds zero value since Scrum is a simple framework to learn but hard to practice.
<br><br>
				<i>*As of today from available certificates I would recommend https://www.scrum.org/.</i>
